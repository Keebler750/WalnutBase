Create new branch:
July 25, 2024 - Create test-1 branch and edit description in config. This will be where I fix some
messy code and bugs, while leaving the working code alone.


test-1 branch:

- create better variable names for waypoint change tracking, move to MathFunctions.h 
and streamline use in function DrawEntry...does not need to be passed in, since I can access the variable
directly since it is outside function scope.

- Differentiated the difference between the position inside the vector, and actual waypoint ID. Only the former
exists for now. Plan is to track IDs so they can be sorted or moved around inside the vector.

- ## SQUASHED:: bug (Issue 001) **** Fuel used changes with conversion of nm/km.... it should use the same fuel!!
- ## fixed by addressing how distances and fuel rate calcs are related via conversion factors (rate is in Lbs/NM, and haversine spits out KM)
		SEE: FUELandUNITSdiagram.tif (Desktop) and UnitsIssue.txt (this Project)

		a) Need to understand all the types of calculations and how they relate
		b) PARTIAL - Would be nice to make a core implementation and an external way to configure possible user scenarios that output non-dimensional data to the core

- DONE - Outline the processes attached to the Fuel Use bug - Fuel Rate needed to be converted wrt 'units' as well!
- DONE - re-write distance and fuel calcs
- DONE - Change some more variable names for readability


test-1 branch:
July 28, 2024
- convert fuel rate var to float to allow application of conversion factor which caused truncation as an int.


test-1 branch:
July 29, 2024
- add new fuel flow functionality when setting units
- make haversine function return NAUTICAL MILES to standardize the calculations
- reduce unneeded code duplication that the Issue #001 bug fix solved
