Create new branch:
July 25, 2024 - Create test-1 branch and edit description in config. This will be where I fix some
messy code and bugs, while leaving the working code alone.


test-1 branch:
July 25, 2024 - create better variable names for waypoint change tracking, move to MathFunctions.h 
and streamline use in function DrawEntry...does not need to be passed in, since I can access the variable
directly since it is outside function scope.

Differentiated the difference between the position inside the vector, and actual waypoint ID. Only the former
exists for now. Plan is to track IDs so they can be sorted or moved around inside the vector.
