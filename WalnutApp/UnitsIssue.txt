OUTLINE: ISSUE 001
STATUS: DONE, July 27, 2024

"Units" item initialized  in MathFunctions.h, line 23

Radio buttons set units ref at line 67 of WalnutApp.cpp

Default is set to '2' which is nautical miles

 >>> NOTE: Do I need to pass units by param into DrawEntry when I can just use a ref?

 Units passed into DrawEntry(), MathFunctions.h on line 98 for use in calcs

 Line 175, MathFunctions.h is start of calcs using units....this code could be streamlined to call a quick conversion function

 ## Fuel rate and distances needed to be addressed wrt conversion factors in ALL calcs in order to work.
