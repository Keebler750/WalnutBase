- WIP (FUNCTIONAL) - Validate (Clamp) waypoint input to limit latitude to +-90 and longitude to +- 180 degrees

- we pass 'a' into drawEntry in MathFunctions.h in a pretty lazy fashion. Name the vars better!!!

- BUG **** Fuel used changes with conversion of nm/km.... it should use the same fuel!!

- How to deal with limit cases for 'antipodes?'

- Take all calculations out of the render loop.

- Add 'Insert' and 'Delete' waypoint options

- WIP - Menu structure.

- Get app to communicate with DCS to avoid manual waypoint inputs.

- File handling to Save and Load prior work.

- Add Alternate Landing/Refuel waypoints and calculations.

- Use more sophisticated formatting, perhaps Tables, Tabs, etc.

- Can ImGui be updated to the latest version without breaking Walnut?

- Is it possible to draw outputs on an integral map?

- >>>> Flight and Fuel profiles needed for multiple aircraft.

- Scratchpad for copy/pasting waypoint data as an interim to actual input from DCS

- Allow user to pull up a data window for the aircraft. "View Data"

- Climb and Decel ramps added to legs; Leg subprofiles and graphics?

- How to generate Mission Planner/Kneeboard info?

- DONE - Deal with North(1), South(-1), East(1), West(-1) so that "-1" affects the haversine output properly.

- DONE - Stop vector emplace_back race condition in which action occurred EACH while-loop. Vector kept growing!

- CONVERSION Metric (x,y) to LAT/LONT will require ---> 0.00000900776 deg LAT = 1.0 meters and 0.000011567285 deg LONG = 1.0 meters
	need the converted LAT/LONG of each map Bullseye/Origin and then the x and y inside the .miz file for each waypoint.

- Make dropdown list of Maps, and attached Origin LAT/LONG in decimal degrees would probably be best.
