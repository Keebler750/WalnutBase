TODO:

- better button icons instead of text.
- would iterator implementation help with editing or tracking?


BUGS:




Notes:
- what will be needed in the design to track how the waypoints move around in the vector?
ANSWER: Just redraw the entire vector contents and do calcs on them as needed.

- What happens to the calculations if waypoints are moved?

- FUTURE: What happens to saved data and moves or edits? Maybe pointers to the data will stay persistent if
the waypoint order moves?

- TOOLS: Vector insert, erase, swap, clear

- The waypoint data represents the current structure, but the unedited location is AT THE END of the vector, until 
	we tell it otherwise. This is why ADD puts new data at the end. 

- Editing the contents of the waypoint data in the InputFloat works because we are targeting with .at( ) .... 

CONSIDERATIONS:
- bounds checking - Use .end() and .size()

- errors from mixed data, or un-recalculated data


FINISHED/CLEARED:

- DONE - if we are making the data mobile within the vector, we need a data ID OTHER than the vectorPOS

- DONE - Add "Insert, Delete, MoveUp, MoveDown" Waypoint editing buttons
