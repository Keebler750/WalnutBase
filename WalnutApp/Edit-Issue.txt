ToDo - Add "Insert, Delete, MoveUp, MoveDown" Waypoint editing buttons

BUGS:

- FIXED: BUG - edited values like to bypass the recalc. Why? NOTES: When running calc after b_valueChanged we are passing ONLY specific vector pos, 
	not recalculating entire vector. So, we need a way to trigger calc not only after value change, but vector structure change.


Notes:
- what will be needed in the design to track how the waypoints move around in the vector?

- What happens to the calculations if waypoints are moved?

- FUTURE: What happens to saved data and moves or edits?

- TOOLS: Vector insert, erase, swap

- The waypoint data represents the current structure, but the unedited location is AT THE END of the vector, until 
	we tell it otherwise. This is why ADD puts new data at the end. 

- Editing the contents of the waypoint data in the InputFloat works because we are targeting with .at( ) .... 

CONSIDERATIONS:
- bounds checking 

- errors from mixed data, or un-recalculated data

- if we are making the data mobile within the vector, we need a data ID OTHER than the vectorPOS
